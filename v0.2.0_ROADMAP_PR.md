- [ ] Citation tracking in responses
- [ ] Search budget controls
- [ ] Rate limiting per domain

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agent can search the web with proper attribution
- Results are cached appropriately
- Budget limits enforced
- Citations included in responses

### 2. RAG Improvements 📚

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks  
**Milestones:**
- [ ] Vector database integration (Chroma, Pinecone, Qdrant)
- [ ] Document indexing for workspace files
- [ ] Semantic search across project files
- [ ] Context window optimization
- [ ] Retrieval quality scoring
- [ ] Multi-document querying
- [ ] Code understanding (AST parsing)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agent can search project files semantically
- Relevant context retrieved efficiently
- Vector DB integrated and working
- Code understanding improves accuracy

### 3. Skills Library Expansion 🛠️

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Milestones:**
- [ ] React scaffolding with TypeScript
- [ ] Next.js full-stack templates
- [ ] Tailwind CSS integration
- [ ] PostgreSQL migrations
- [ ] Redis caching setup
- [ ] CI/CD templates (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- [ ] Docker multi-stage builds
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 5+ new skills available
- Skills generate working code
- Tests included for each skill
- Documentation for each skill

### 4. Faster Planning & Caching ⚡

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks  
**Milestones:**
- [ ] Plan caching for similar prompts
- [ ] Incremental planning (reuse previous plans)
- [ ] Parallel tool execution where safe
- [ ] Plan optimization (merge similar steps)
- [ ] Result caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Streaming responses (real-time updates)
- [ ] Progress indicators

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Planning time reduced by 30%+
- Cache hit rate > 50% for similar prompts
- Parallel execution works safely
- Progress visible to users

## Timeline

**Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Web Search Integration
**Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-5):** RAG Improvements  
**Sprint 3 (Weeks 6-8):** Skills Library Expansion
**Sprint 4 (Weeks 9-10):** Faster Planning & Caching

**Total Estimated Duration:** 10 weeks

## Dependencies

- Web Search: API keys for Google/Bing (if using paid APIs)
- RAG: Vector database service (optional, can use local)
- Skills: No external dependencies

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Web Search API Costs
- **Mitigation:** Implement strict budget limits, caching, rate limiting

### Risk: Vector DB Complexity
- **Mitigation:** Start with local Chroma, add cloud services later

### Risk: Skills Maintenance
- **Mitigation:** Automated testing, versioning, documentation

## Success Metrics

- Web search: 80%+ success rate for search queries
- RAG: 50%+ improvement in context relevance
- Skills: 5+ new skills, 90%+ generation success rate
- Performance: 30%+ reduction in planning time

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve roadmap
2. Assign developers to features
3. Create individual issues for each milestone
4. Set up project board
5. Begin Sprint 1
